### Concept Paper "Bifroest Wallet"

Userstory:
The User wants to take full self custody over their Funds but still be able to swap directly into a dollar-pegged stablecoin.
Frictionless with nearly no third party involved.

The Problem:
All existing solutions require central parties and are additional enforced by regulations to require KYC (with all known risks this includes).
One of the man critics e.g. at the El Salvadorian Chivo Wallet.

The solution:
A self-custody lightning-wallet, like SBW (Simple Bitcoin Wallet) with an inbuilt Exchange (using the OpenDex technology) with a liquidity Pool out of Bitcoin in a Lightning Channel and DoC (Dollar On Chain) from the Rootstock (merge mined BTC-) Sidechain in a Connext Payment Channel to get the ability to instantly exchange BTC on lighting into DOC and vice versa.

Sidenote:
I'm not a coder, and so I'm not able to fill this idea with life on my own.
But hearing the problem again and again in various podcasts and having the idea in mind, I felt like I should write it down in some sentences so maybe one, two or hundreds of passionate coders could bring it to life.
My idea combines a lot of existing  (Bitcoin, only!) based protocols to one independent solution - I think - the world needs.

Side-Note about the naming:
The Bifroest is the also known as the rainbow bridge which was used in the Norway mythology for traveling between the world's (also used by Thor the God of thunder and lightning).
